Question 1
Synchonizer: Eric
Liason: Shireen 
Reflector: Jenny

Question 2.2
2.2.1
yes
2.2.2
The print statement in Car.py does print, beacuse the details of the Dodge Dart is printed to the console, while electricCar1 was not assigned as a Dodge Dart.
2.2.3
In Python code, import statements allow the code from one file to be in another. Also, if code is not in a if __name__ == "__main__" block, it will also run the code, hence the print statement from Car.py was run.

Question 2.3
2.3.1
no
2.3.2
yes
2.3.3
The effect of the "if __name__ == "__main__" block makes it so that the code inside that block runs only if the file has the name "__main__"
2.3.4
The value of __name__ when you execute a file is __main__, while the value of __name__ when you import a file is not __main__. When the file is executed, the code in the if __name__ == "__main" is excuted, while when it's being imported, the code is not being executed.

Question 3.1
The line that reads #super().__init__() contributes to this error, because the ElectricCar class is not inheriting the methods from class Car. As a result, the class ElectricCar does not have the method get_make_model(), which is causing the error.
